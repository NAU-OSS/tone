# *tone*
*tone* is a lightweight, command-line tool for hobby audio production and experimentation. This software is designed to be modular and encourages private forks and modifications for personal features and preferences.

## Requirements
- Unix-like system
- Bash
- Audio input/output devices

## Installation Instrucitons
- Currently, there is nothing to install! Gain access to the project source code directly following the instructions in the *Getting Started* section below for continuous updates

## Usage
- *tone* will be accessed entirely through the command-line via the ```tone``` keyword followed by the desired command to control sessions
- Examples:
    - ```tone session start``` to begin the program
- Interact with the program directly after a session has started via the command-line interface

## Project Roadmap
- Create a command-line interface for interpreting commands during sessions
- Handle and process audio track recording in real time
- Allow storage of compressed and noncompressed tracks
- Organize tracks for storage and simultaneous device output
- Allow for user-defined modules to apply to audio transforms
